Would like to use flarectl on mac to add 311 domains to CloudFlare.com

Installed cloudflare-go using https://brew.sh and Go 

With the command 

go get -u github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-go/


Running:
./flarectl h

works and the displays latest version.






QUESTION:
Next thing is a problem:

Re:
"You must set your API key and account email address in the environment variables CF_API_KEY and CF_API_EMAIL."

Could anyone please point in the right direction?

Where is the / how to  "environment variable"?
